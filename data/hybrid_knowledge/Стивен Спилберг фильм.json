{"content": "Steven Spielberg is an American filmmaker. He is considered one of the founding pioneers of the New Hollywood era, as well as one of the most popular directors and producers in film history. He is also one of the co-founders of Amblin Entertainment and DreamWorks Pictures.\nIn a career spanning more than five decades, Spielberg's films have spanned many themes and genres. Spielberg's early science-fiction and adventure films were seen as archetypes of modern Hollywood escapist filmmaking. In later years, his films began addressing humanistic issues such as the Holocaust, the transatlantic slave trade, civil rights, war, and terrorism.\nSpielberg won the Academy Award for Best Director for Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, as well as receiving six other nominations. Three of Spielberg's films—Jaws, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, and Jurassic Park—achieved box office records, originated, and came to epitomize the blockbuster film. The worldwide box office receipts of all Spielberg-directed films exceeds $10 billion, making him the highest-grossing director in cinematic history.", "sources_count": 1, "entities": ["Amblin Entertainment", "New Hollywood", "DreamWorks Pictures.
