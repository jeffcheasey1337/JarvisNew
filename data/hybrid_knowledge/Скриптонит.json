{"content": "Ädıl Oralbekūly Jälelov (né Kulmagambetov; born 3 June 1990), known professionally as Skryptonite (Russian: Скриптонит, romanized: Skriptonit), is a Kazakh rapper, singer, songwriter, and music producer. He is the founder of the record label Musica36.\nSkryptonite gained prominence in 2013 after releasing a music video for his debut single, «VBVVCTND». His first studio album, Dom s normalnymi yavleniyami (transl. House with Normal Activity), followed in late 2014 and became one of the most commercially successful Russian-language rap albums of 2015.\nIn 2018, Skryptonite divided his artistic output into two distinct projects: Skryptonite (as a solo act) and Gruppa Skryptonite (Russian: Группа Скриптонит; \"Skryptonite Group\"). According to the artist, this separation reflects differences in both live performances and recorded material. Gruppa Skryptonite functions as an eight-member band performing reimagined arrangements, while solo Skryptonite concerts adhere to a \"rapper and DJ\" format with backing tracks.\nIn 2021, Skryptonite was named the most-streamed artist in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) by the media outlet Muzyka Pervogo.\n\n", "sources_count": 1, "entities": ["Normal Activity),", "Musica36.
