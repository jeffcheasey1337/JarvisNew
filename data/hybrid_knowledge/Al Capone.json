Michele Salvemini; род. 9 октября 1973 года, Мольфетта, Апулия) — итальянский рэпер, певец, автор песен и музыкальный продюсер.\n\nAlphonse Gabriel Capone ( kə-POHN; Italian: [kaˈpoːne]; January 17, 1899 – January 25, 1947), sometimes known by the nickname \"Scarface\", was an American gangster and businessman who attained notoriety during the Prohibition era as the co-founder and boss of the Chicago Outfit from 1925 to 1931.

He made donations to various charities and was viewed by many as a \"modern-day Robin Hood\". The Saint Valentine's Day Massacre, in which seven people from rival gangs were murdered in broad daylight, damaged the public image of Chicago and Capone, leading influential citizens to demand government action and newspapers to dub Capone \"Public Enemy No. 1\".\nFederal authorities became intent on jailing Capone and charged him with twenty-two co", "sources_count": 2, "entities": ["Chicago Outfit", "Mayor William Hale", "Chicago Police Department", "Capone.
