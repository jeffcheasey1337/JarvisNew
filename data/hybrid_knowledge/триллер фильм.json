{"content": "Thriller film, also known as suspense film or suspense thriller, is a broad film genre that evokes excitement and suspense in the audience. The suspense element found in most films' plots is particularly exploited by the filmmaker in this genre. Tension is created by delaying what the audience sees as inevitable, and is built through situations that are menacing or where escape seems impossible.\nThe cover-up of important information from the viewer, and fight and chase scenes are common methods. Life is typically threatened in a thriller film, such as when the protagonist does not realize that they are entering a dangerous situation. Thriller films' characters conflict with each other or with an outside force, which can sometimes be abstract. The protagonist is usually set against a problem, such as an escape, a mission, or a mystery.\nScreenwriter and scholar Eric R. Williams identifies thriller films as one of eleven super-genres in his screenwriters' taxonomy, claiming all feature-length narrative films can be classified by these super-genres. The other ten are action, crime, fantasy, horror, romance, science fiction, a slice of life, sports, war, and western. Thriller films are typically hybridized with other super-genres; hybrids commonly include action thrillers, fantasy and science fiction thrillers. Thriller films share a close relationship with horror films, both eliciting tension.

Common themes include terrorism, political conspiracy, pursuit and romantic triangles leading to murder.\nIn 2001, the American Film Institute (AFI) made its selection of the top 100 greatest American \"heart-pounding\" and \"adrenaline-inducing\" films of all time. The 400 nominated films had to be American-made whose thrills have \"enlivened and enriched America's film heritage\".
